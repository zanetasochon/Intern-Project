# OpenX Intern Project

This project is a solution to the OpenX intern project, which involves retrieving data from the following API endpoints:

Users: https://fakestoreapi.com/users

Carts: https://fakestoreapi.com/carts/?startdate=2000-01-01&enddate=2023-04-07

Products: https://fakestoreapi.com/products

The program has the following features:

1. Retrieves user, product, and shopping cart data from the API endpoints,

2. Creates a data structure containing all available product categories and the total value of products of a given category,

3. Finds a cart with the highest value, determines its value and the full name of its owner,
4. Finds the two users living furthest away from each other.
